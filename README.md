# CSIT-5410-Recognition-System
## Assignment 1:

In this assignment, you will use Octave/MATLAB to program three functions myquantizer for 
image quantization, myscaler for image rescaling and mysobeledge for image edge. You need 
to complete the missing implementations in the corresponding M-files. From the course 
CANVAS website, you can download the M-files and related files.

## Assignment 2:

Task 1: Hough Transform for Line Detection

Task 2: Fisher Linear Discriminant

## Assignment 3:

In this section, you are required to implement a simple object detection system with the 
Adaboost algorithm. Specifically, the object detection system can find out all the dogs inside 
an image and label it with a bounding box. The object detection system consists of feature 
extraction, a set of weak classifiers, Adaboost algorithm, and sliding window.

Programming task 1 - Feature extraction

Programming task 2 - Weak classifiers

Programming task 3 - Adaboost algorithm and sliding window

Programming task 4 â€“ Report
